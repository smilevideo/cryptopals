My work (in progress) on the cryptopals cryptography programming challenges, probably primarily in Javascript

The challenges are found here: https://cryptopals.com/

Unlike some other programming challenge websites, it looks like they are okay with users publishing their solutions online now. 
*(please let me know if this is not the case)*

## Current Progress:
working on Set 1, challenge 4
