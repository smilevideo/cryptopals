# Cryptopals with Node.js
My work (in progress) on the cryptopals programming challenges, done in Node.js  
Each challenge folder is self-contained; i.e. doesn't use files from elsewhere

The challenges are found here: https://cryptopals.com/


## Current Progress:
- Set 1: complete
currently on hold for job-search activities
