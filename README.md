# Cryptopals with Node.js
My work (in progress) on the cryptopals programming challenges, done in Node.js  
Each challenge folder is self-contained; i.e. it doesn't use files from elsewhere

## Current Progress:
Finished up to set 1, challenge 6

## References:
The challenges are found here: https://cryptopals.com/

Unlike some other programming challenges, it seems like they are okay with users publishing their solutions online.
*(please let me know if this is not the case)*
